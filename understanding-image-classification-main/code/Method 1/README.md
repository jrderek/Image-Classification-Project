## Method 1: K-Nearest-Neighbors

To run the code, first put all the dataset and program file in the same folder.

Download dataset here: 
https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1_962u-W17hZk15UF9MNElSOTg

Put this folder in the same path with script.

If ran in the terminal, go to the directory where the program file located.

Then run the program in the terminal using the command:

    Python –test.py --dataset “dataset_name” --neighbors “# of neighbors”
